Reflections

How long did you spend working on this project?
I spent 20 hours working on this project. 

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
The most rewarding challenge was finding enumerable documentation and using it to learn to access items in the @@transactions array. 

What two additional features did you build? Why?
1. Transaction.print_purchases prints data for all purchases so that the after-mentioned function may be used. 
2. Transaction.cancel_transaction(id_num) cancels a purchase with the id of the parameter id_num so that an order that was entered by mistake may be undone, provided that it hasn’t already been processed by Toy City. 

Where do you still have room to grow?
I don’t understand public, private, and protected methods very well.
